Compiling on Linux
====================

You will need the following packages (and their -dev(el) files) to be installed:

  * libSDL
  * libSDL_image
  * libSDL_ttf
  * libSDL_mixer
  * libSDL_gfx
  * libcurl
  * libarchive
  * cmake
  * C++ compiler (found in packages like g++, gcc-c++, gcc)

The process is simple. Enter a terminal and move to directory containing
MeAndMyShadow. Then just type

  cmake .

to generate the Makefile. If everything configured properly you don't see any
errors and then you can start compiling by typing

  make

Finally you can run MeAndMyShadow with

  ./meandmyshadow

To install MeAndMyShadow on your system, run following as root

  make install



Compiling without GL
====================
In some cases you might want to compile Me and My Shadow without openGL 
hardware accelaration. In order to do this follow the steps above but replace the
cmake call with:

    cmake -DHARDWARE_ACCELERATION=OFF .

Note that you can always run Me and My Shadow in SDL mode by setting gl to 0 in
the config file or by running it as following:

    meandmyshadow -set gl 0
