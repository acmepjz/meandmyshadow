Me and My Shadow 0.5 RC (Release Candidate) has been released.
You can find it on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meandmyshadow/files/0.5rc/).
TRANSLATORS: Please help us translate the game into other languages on
[Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/me-and-my-shadow/)!

A brief list of changes since
[0.5 Beta version]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-25-me-and-my-shadow-0-5-beta-released %}):

* Proper support for translations of plural forms in several places in the game.
* Some bug fixes and improvements to level pack creation and rename logic.
* Updated Simplified Chinese, German, and Scottish Gaelic translations.
* Added Hungarian translation by SanskritFritz.

EDIT: I found that some characters in Hungarian translation are missing.
This is not so easy to fix in 0.5. Maybe you have to wait for 0.5.1.
