Bugs and limitations
--------------------

Known bugs and limitations:

* No proper IME support for text box, etc.
* OSX support is broken.
* The button specification in theme file is changed, old theme may render button incorrectly in new version.
  (The built-in themes and all addon themes are already fixed.)
* Some achievements are not realistic, and there is a typo in achievements.
* Invisible collectible is counted in total number of collectibles.
* The scenery layer naming convention is confusing.
* The target time for tutorial level 10 seems unbeatable. Needs further investigation.
* There seems to be a random crash bug when exiting the game.
  I haven't found a way to reproduce it; it only occurred twice when I change the language multiple times,
  viewing achievements and statistics, and viewing level play select screen.
  I haven't found what's wrong with the code yet, it looks like something like double delete of ThemeBlock, but I'm not sure.
  If you find a way to reproduce this bug or you have located the part of code which is wrong,
  please tell me by either post on the forum, or by submit an issue or pull request on Github.
