Me and My Shadow 0.5a has just been released.
This is a minor bug fix release.
You can find it on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meandmyshadow/files/0.5a/).

* Define paths earlier in CMakeLists.txt, mainly for Linux package build
* Don't use SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING which fails on systems which do not support SDL_INIT_HAPTIC
* Update the target time from 6s to 6.5s of tutorial level 10
* Update Hungarian (by SanskritFritz), Ukrainian (by burunduk and eugeneloza)
  and Russian (by BoFFire, mesnevi and eugeneloza) translations which fixes some bugs
