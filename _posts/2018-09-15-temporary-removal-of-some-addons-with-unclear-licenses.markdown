I'm sorry to announce that we have to remove some addons temporarily due to unclear licenses.
The authors of the addons are Tedium and leovilok on FreeGameDev.
If you are the author of these addons, please contact us on the [forum](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewforum.php?f=48)
and provide an appropriate license.

The following addons will be temporarily removed:

* by Tedium:
  * [Minefield](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2462#p25622)
  * Flight
  * [Expansion](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=3222)
* by leovilok:
  * [Geometry to Chaos](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2922)
